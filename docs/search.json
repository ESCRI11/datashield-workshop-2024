This way they will have their computers with the right software installed to follow the workshop.\nDue the nature of this workshop, the attendants are expected to have some notions of R package development, to cover the basics we included a section titled “R packages 101”, if you are not familiar with R package development please take a look before the workshop.\n\n\nSchedule\nTo be delivered.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is funded by XXX and XXX. Materials developed by Juan R. González (ISGlobal) and Xavier Escribà Montagut (BigOmics Analytics SA).",

    "text": "Installing the packages\nWhen using R, we are used to installing packages with the handy install.packages() function. However, by default it uses the CRAN repository, which does not contain all the required packages. For that reason we provide a quick code snippet to install all the required packages:\n\n# Install DSLite\ninstall.packages(\"DSLite\")\n\n# Install DSI\ninstall.packages(\"DSI\")\n\n# Install dsBase\ninstall.packages(\n    'dsBase',\n    repos=c(\n        getOption('repos'),\n        'http://cran.datashield.org'\n    ),\n    dependencies=TRUE\n)\n\n# Install dsBaseClient\ninstall.packages(\n    'dsBaseClient',\n    repos=c(\n        getOption('repos'),\n        'http://cran.datashield.org'\n    ),\n    dependencies=TRUE\n)\n\nWith that, your environment will be ready to take on the workshop. Nevertheless, please read the next sessions to familiarize with R package development if you are not already.",
