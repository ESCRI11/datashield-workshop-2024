This course is part of WP3 of ATHLETE project.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThis website has been created to host the materials and exercises for the Advanced Users’ DataSHIELD Workshop, hosted at the Center for Mathematics of the University of Bonn Thursday 26th September 2024.\nOn it you will find reading materials, setup tutorials, the workshop indications and practical exercises.\n\n\nGetting started\nBefore the workshop we suggest the atendants to take a look at the “Environment setup” and “Get up to speed” sections. This way they will have their computers with the right software installed to follow the workshop.\nDue the nature of this workshop, the attendants are expected to have some notions of R package development, to cover the basics please follow the material available on the “Get up to speed” section, we suggest participants with limited knowledge of R package development to check that out before taking the workshop.\nIf the attendant is familiar with R package development, we just advice to follow the “Environment setup” to make sure we spend no time during the workshop installing packages.\n\n\nSchedule\nTo be delivered.\n\n\nCredits\nMaterials developed by Juan R. González (ISGlobal) and Xavier Escribà Montagut (BigOmics Analytics SA).",

    "text": "Install guide\nWhen using R, we are used to installing packages with the handy install.packages() function. However, by default it uses the CRAN repository, which does not contain all the required packages. For that reason we provide a quick code snippet to install all the required packages:\n\n# Install DSLite\ninstall.packages(\"DSLite\")\n\n# Install DSI\ninstall.packages(\"DSI\")\n\n# Install dsBase\ninstall.packages(\n    'dsBase',\n    repos=c(\n        getOption('repos'),\n        'http://cran.datashield.org'\n    ),\n    dependencies=TRUE\n)\n\n# Install dsBaseClient\ninstall.packages(\n    'dsBaseClient',\n    repos=c(\n        getOption('repos'),\n        'http://cran.datashield.org'\n    ),\n    dependencies=TRUE\n)\n\nWith that, your environment will be ready to take on the workshop. Nevertheless, please read the next sessions to familiarize with R package development if you are not already.",
