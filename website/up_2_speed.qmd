This workshop has been concived as an Advanced workshop to provide a guide to develop new DataSHIELD packages. Nevertheless, it may happend that not so experienced users/developers enroll on the workshop or happen to find this online material without prior experience. It is for that matter that this section is included, to provide a basis of knowledge about DataSHIELD before embarking on this short but steep journey.

Here, we provide different reading materials that will be useful to create a solid basis about DataSHIELD.

+ [DataSHIELD paper](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/43/6/1929/707730?login=true): Description of what is DataSHIELD.
+ [DataSHIELD wiki](https://data2knowledge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSDEV/overview): Materials about DataSHIELD including:
    + Beginner material
    + Recorded DataSHIELD workshops
    + Information on current release of DataSHIELD
+ [resource book](https://isglobal-brge.github.io/resource_bookdown/): In this book you will find information about:
    + DataSHIELD (Section 5)

Also, a shameless plug ^[From Xavier Escrib√†], if any reader finds this material is not enough, I encourage reading my [PhD thesis](https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/691737#page=1), where DataSHIELD is the center piece and it is explained in fine grained detail.
